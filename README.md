# Cool URIs on ariel-os.org

[Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI),
and everything about Ariel OS is cool.
Therefore, our URIs don't change.

To ensure that our URIs don't change
even when the technology we serve them with changes
or the content of the URIs changes,
this document keeps track of which URIs we minted in the first place.

When we start placing actual content,
we don't need to track every single path,
but we should have a rough plan for how links stay working.

## Active URIs

* <https://ariel-os.org/>, <https://www.ariel-os.org/>

  (on the long run, we may pick the former as the canonical and redirect the other there)

  redirect to <https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os>

* <https://crab.ariel-os.org/>

* All `http://` URIs just redirect to `https://`
